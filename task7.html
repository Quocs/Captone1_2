                    Contact tracing is the process of identifying, 
                    assessing, and managing people who have been exposed 
                    to someone who has been infected with the COVID-19 virus.
                    Contact tracing and quarantine of contacts identified through 
                    contact tracing interrupt transmission between people and are essential 
                    public health tools for controlling the virus. Contact tracing can also 
                    help people who are at a higher risk of developing severe disease know earlier 
                    that they have been exposed so that they can  get medical care quicker if they go on 
                    to develop symptoms.

                Yes. 
                Contact tracing is an essential public health tool for controlling infectious disease outbreaks,
                such as those caused bythe COVID-19 virus. Contact tracing can break the chains of transmission
                through the rapid identification, isolation and clinical care of cases, and providing supported 
                quarantine of contacts, meaning that virus transmission can be stopped.

                Yes, the principles of contact tracing remain the same for newly identified variants of the COVID-19 virus. 
                While some of the variants of the virus are more transmissible, thorough and timely contact tracing and 
                supported quarantine of contacts is even more important to control the spread of the virus

              <div class="accordion-item-body-content">
              <p>
                If you think you may be a contact of someone who has recently been infected, 
                you should be contacted by health authorities to determine if you meet the contact definition. 
                You may also be informed directly by someone you were in contact with who later tested positive. 
                If you have downloaded a COVID-19 proximity tracing application, 
                you may also get notified through your mobile phone.
              </p>
              <br>
                <p>
                   If you are identified as a contact, you should undertake quarantine, 
                   which means that you separate yourself from others in your household,
                   stay there and monitor your health for any signs of illness. 
                   Some countries have set up dedicated facilities to enable contacts 
                   to complete quarantine outside their household. Contact your local health authorities 
                   to find out how you can safely quarantine.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    WHO recommends that you stay in quarantine for 14 days after you were last in contact with the 
                    person infected with the COVID-19 virus, but the duration of quarantine may vary by country. 
                    Check with your local or national health authority.

            How is digital proximity tracing data stored and protected ?

                The data storage for tracing apps can either be stored and processed on a central server managed by the national public health authority, or stored and processed on the users’ phones. There is a consensus by several data protection authorities that storing data on users’ phones enhances privacy, since users have greater control over the amount of information that they share with health authorities. The collection and use of such data by health authorities can therefore be limited to what is strictly necessary for the operation of a digital tracing system
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>Whichever approach is selected, governments and third parties should ensure digital tracing systems follow WHO guidance on ethical considerations on the use of digital proximity tracing for COVID-19 contact tracing. Protecting the personal data and privacy of individuals participating in digital tracing is critical to ensure the protection of human rights and civil liberties as well as the establishment of public trust. </p>
